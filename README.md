# ICTer2023 Workshop - Embracing-RISC-V


In this workshiop participants will get an introduction to RISC-V architecture, hands-on tutorial to build a simple OS kernel, bootloader, and hardware interfacing.

In the hands-on tutorial we build a simple boot loader and boot StarFive Vision 2 boarf. 

To build the boot loader, we need to [setup the GNU tool chain](tool-chain-setup.md).
